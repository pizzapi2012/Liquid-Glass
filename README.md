I used https://github.com/Nezz/homeassistant-visionos-theme (liquid glass dark) for the theme.
I used https://github.com/joseluis9595/lovelace-navbar-card for the navbar and I will share the config file for it in this repo. ~~and i adpated https://therobbiedavis.com/how-to-recreate-the-ios-26-glassy-effect-with-css/ style sheet for the styling of the navbar.~~
